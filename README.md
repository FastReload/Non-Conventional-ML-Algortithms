### ðŸ“Š Machine Learning and Data Analysis Essentials

This repository showcases Python-based data analysis and machine learning workflows, leveraging popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and advanced gradient boosting tools such as CatBoost and XGBoost. Key features include:

- **Data Handling:** Efficient data manipulation and visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib.
- **Preprocessing Pipelines:** Automated workflows using Scikit-learnâ€™s `Pipeline`, `ColumnTransformer`, and preprocessing tools (`SimpleImputer`, `OneHotEncoder`, `StandardScaler`).
- **Model Training:** Gradient Boosting with `GradientBoostingRegressor`, `CatBoostRegressor`, and `XGBRegressor`.
- **Model Evaluation:** Cross-validation, grid search, and error metrics like Mean Squared Error (`mean_squared_error`).
- **Tabular Presentation:** Enhanced output formatting with `tabulate`.

This setup serves as a foundation for building and fine-tuning machine learning models, with streamlined preprocessing and hyperparameter optimization workflows. ðŸš€
